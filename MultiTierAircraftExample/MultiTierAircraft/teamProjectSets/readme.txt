In the original demo we had set up workspaces that reflect different points in time.
For that purpose TeamProjectSets were set up - a mechanism in Eclipse that allows you to 
define a configuration of projects to be checked out together into a workspace.

At this time the psf files still point to the original repository at AVSI, 
but it gives you an idea about the subsetting.
